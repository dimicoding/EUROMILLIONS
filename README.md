Euromillions was first launched on February 7th, and the original participating countries were France, the UK, and Spain. This lottery game is deeply ingrained in Portuguese culture, especially in small towns like the one where I grew up.

Despite the game's relatively low cost of â‚¬2.50 per ticket, the odds of winning the jackpot with a randomly generated combination of numbers are extremely slim. With a total of 2,118,760 five-number combinations possible, the overall odds of getting the correct numbers are 1 in 95 million. In fact, it would take 100 tickets purchased every week for the next 18,000 years to match those odds!

Nevertheless, the dream of becoming a millionaire is still a powerful draw for many people, regardless of their socio-economic background. This game holds a special place in the hearts of millions, and for this reason, I have created a nostalgic web simulation of the popular lottery game, giving users a chance to test their luck.

## Responsiveness
The website page is responsive and tested on different browsers: Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Opera GX, and Mi(phone-Xiaomi). The following media queries were used:

- @media (min-width: 1281px)

- @media (min-width: 1025px) and (max-width: 1280px) 

- @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) 

- @media (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 767px) 

- @media (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px)


# Fixed Bugs

- Many issues occurred along the journey using JavaScript, some ideas like creating an additional 1-12 star section buttons with two more options of choice for the user had to be left out.
- Making the buttons of the number section change color, and be outputted into the user-input section took almost two days of troubleshooting until I found the solution to use the .active when the button is pressed.
- Comparing the chosen numbers from the users-input with randomly generated numbers was causing errors and most of the time nothing would happen. I found the solution by going through the love maths project, the main issue is that I wasn't comparing the same values(string-number), so parseInt played a key role.
- Many other bugs wouldn't be solved without the use of other sources mentioned in the credits section.


# Deployment
For this project, I used the Gitpod browser as a development environment from where I committed and pushed my last changes to my repository in GitHub.

To deploy the project first I had to do:
- Go to the GitHub repository EUROMILLIONS.
- Navigate to the Settings tab.
- Select the main branch and save.
- In one minute and after refreshing my browser the link has been successfully deployed.

To ensure that the link was up to date and running smoothly I opened the link from the nav function called "actions".
