Euromillions was first launched on February 7th, and the original participating countries were France, the UK, and Spain. This lottery game is deeply ingrained in Portuguese culture, especially in small towns like the one where I grew up.

Despite the game's relatively low cost of â‚¬2.50 per ticket, the odds of winning the jackpot with a randomly generated combination of numbers are extremely slim. With a total of 2,118,760 five-number combinations possible, the overall odds of getting the correct numbers are 1 in 95 million. In fact, it would take 100 tickets purchased every week for the next 18,000 years to match those odds!

Nevertheless, the dream of becoming a millionaire is still a powerful draw for many people, regardless of their socio-economic background. This game holds a special place in the hearts of millions, and for this reason, I have created a nostalgic web simulation of the popular lottery game, giving users a chance to test their luck.
